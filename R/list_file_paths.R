#' @title list_file_paths
#'
#' @description a wrapper for the base function list.files(). Instead of returning just the list of the file names, it returns the full path to those files as a named list.
#'
#' @param path full path names; the default corresponds to the working directory, getwd(). Tilde expansion (see path.expand) is performed. Missing values will be ignored.
#' @param pattern an optional regular expression. Only file names which match the regular expression will be returned.
#' @param all.files a logical value. If FALSE, only the names of visible files are returned. If TRUE, all file names will be returned.
#' @param full.names a logical value. If TRUE, the directory path is prepended to the file names to give a relative file path. If FALSE, the file names (rather than paths) are returned.
#' @param recursive logical. Should the listing recurse into directories?
#' @param ignore.case logical. Should pattern-matching be case-insensitive?
#' @param include.dirs logical. Should subdirectory names be included in recursive listings? (They always are in non-recursive ones).
#' @param no.. logical. Should both "." and ".." be excluded also from non-recursive listings?
#' @param return_absolute logical. Should absolute file paths be returned. If false, only relative file paths are returned.

#' @return
